# St. Remy Fire Department Information and Inventory System


## Problem Description

The Saint Remy Volunteer Fire Department provides emergency services to Saint Remy, New Salem, Ulster Park, Union Center, in the Town of Esopus NY. It is a small, rural department with 25 active members. The fire department responds to a wide variety of calls including car accidents, car fires, brush fires, downed power lines, hazardous material incidents, gas leaks, CO2 poisoning, search and rescue, water rescue, ice rescue, medical emergencies, and structure fires. In addition, they assist police and EMS in a variety of emergency situations, and the occasional cat stuck in a tree.

Due to the broad nature of the emergencies that the department responds to, a wide variety of specialized training is required. Upon completion of the appropriate training and certification, the fire department issues the appropriate personal protective equipment and gear to the firefighters. The St. Remy Fire Department is a historically under-resourced department. As the variety and amount of gear issued grew over the years, the departmental capacity to track the issued gear inventory did not.

## Goals

The system will:
Utilize a database to store information about each piece of inventoried gear

Provide a web interface for both data entry/editing and lookups

Generate QR codes to print and affix to pieces of gear

Interface with camera or barcode/QR scanner to facilitate lookups

Provide web interface to lookup individual firefighters and see what gear was issued to them
